# Recipe Writing Style Guide

Key principles for writing excellent recipes, based on NYT Cooking's approach:

## Structure and Organization
Start with a compelling headnote that tells the story behind the dish, its origins, or what makes it special. Follow with a clear ingredient list ordered by when items are used, then step-by-step instructions that flow logically.

## Precision with Flexibility
Provide specific measurements and times while acknowledging that cooking is variable. Use phrases like "until golden brown, about 5 minutes" or "season to taste." Include both volume and weight measurements for key ingredients when helpful.

## Descriptive Language
Use sensory cues that help cooks recognize success: "until the onions are translucent and smell sweet" or "the mixture should hold together when squeezed but not be wet." Paint a picture of what good looks, sounds, and smells like.

## Practical Details
Include prep time, cook time, and serving size upfront. Mention equipment needs early. Address common pitfalls with phrases like "be careful not to overmix" or "if the sauce seems too thick, add pasta water gradually."

## Step Formatting
Always name each step with 2-3 descriptive words and include a time estimate in parentheses. Example: "Prepare Eggplant (1 hr 15 min)" or "Cook Meat Base (15 min)". This helps cooks understand what they're doing and plan their time effectively.

## Accessibility and Substitutions
Acknowledge dietary restrictions and offer substitutions naturally within the recipe. Explain techniques briefly rather than assuming knowledge—"fold gently" gets a quick explanation of the folding motion.

## Testing and Reliability
Every instruction should be tested and reliable. Times and temperatures should work in most home kitchens. Build in checkpoints so cooks can self-correct if needed.

## Voice and Confidence
Write with authority but warmth. Use active voice and direct commands. Trust that following your instructions will lead to success, and convey that confidence to the reader.

## Research and Context
When creating recipes, research the dish's origins, cultural significance, and traditional preparation methods using web search. This background information should inform the compelling headnote that tells the story behind the dish and what makes it special.

## Primary Flavors
Include a flavor description paragraph within the title area, positioned after the yield and timing information. Use 1-2 sentences that describe the dish's flavor progression and relationships using sensory-focused language. Rather than simply listing flavor characteristics, explain how different elements interact—such as how bright acidity cuts through rich fats, or how aromatic herbs complement earthy vegetables. This integrated approach gives readers an immediate preview of the dining experience while maintaining clean layout flow alongside the recipe image.
